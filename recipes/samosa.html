    <h1>Samosa</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Samosas are ubiquitous in India. Vendors, shops, school and college
      canteens, and every M.G. Road in every Indian city. People will gladly
      walk through winding lanes or brave traffic to get to that special dukaan
      or halwai selling delectable samosas. Samosa, a ‘bad guy’ is blamed for
      diet bloopers, weight gain, cholesterol – for pretty much everything and
      anything; however, it is still the King of Indian street food, loved by
      toddlers to grandpas. It’s braved the invasions of pizzas and pastas and
      held on to its post, so give it some credit, won’t you?

      You pause after piercing the outer shell and inhaling the aroma. You bite
      into a piece as the brittle crust and soft potatoes laced with caraway,
      coriander, and chillies dissolve. Your nod communicates the experience
      without using words. You can't stop at one, and after two, your stomach is
      full; but your heart craves more, and you commit more sins of guilty
      eating.

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine flour, ghee, salt and caraway seeds until
        mixture resembles bread crumbs. Gradually stir in enough water to form a
        firm dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and
        elastic, 6-8 minutes. Cover and let rest for 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a
        boil. Reduce heat and cook until just tender, 8-10 minutes; drain. Set
        aside to cool slightly. In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons oil over
        medium heat. Add potatoes and cook until potatoes start to cling to the
        skillet, about 5 minutes. Stir in peas, ginger, garam masala, cumin
        seeds and salt; cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir in
        optional ingredients as desired. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide dough into 6 pieces. Roll 1 piece of dough into a 10x6-in. oval.
        Cut dough in half. Moisten straight edge with water. Bring 1 corner of
        half moon up to meet the other corner of half moon, forming a cone.
        Pinch seam to seal. Fill with 3-4 tablespoons potato mixture. Moisten
        curved edge of dough with water; fold over top of filling and press seam
        to seal. Gently press the bottom of each samosa to flatten slightly.
        Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat air fryer to 350°. Brush the samosas with the remaining 3
        tablespoons oil. In batches, arrange in a single layer, without
        touching, on tray in air-fryer basket. Cook until golden brown, about 15
        minutes.
