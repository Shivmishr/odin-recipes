      Is there a more perfect food than a quesadilla? They’re simple to
      assemble, quick to cook, and satisfy every carby, cheesy craving we could
      ever have. We enjoy them for a quick lunch, a cheap and easy dinner, and
      especially as a midnight snack. Okay okay, sure, you’re probably thinking
      you don’t really need a recipe for this insanely popular Mexican dish.

    <p>
      A quesadilla is a Mexican dish that dates back to the 16th century.
      Traditional quesadillas were made with a corn tortilla that was warmed on
      a griddle, filled with cheese and various other fillings (meat,
      vegetables), and then folded over to be eaten by hand.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Large flour tortillas</li>
      <li>Grated cheese such as mild or sharp cheddar, or Monterey Jack</li>
      <li>Sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>Green onions</li>
      <li>Black olives, sliced</li>
      <li>Fresh tomatoes, diced</li>
      <li>Chicken pieces</li>
      <li>Avocado</li>
      <li>Lettuce</li>
      <li>Apple cider vinegar</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Olive oil or butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet (cast iron works great) on medium high heat. Add a
        small amount of oil (about 1/2 teaspoon) and spread it around the bottom
        of the pan with a spatula (you could use butter as well).
      </li>
      <li>
        Take one large flour tortilla and place it in the pan. Flip the tortilla
        over a few times, 10 seconds between flips. Air pockets should begin to
        form within the tortilla.
      </li>
      <li>
        When pockets of air begin to form, take a handful of grated cheese,
        sprinkle over the top of the tortilla, making sure that the cheese does
        not land on the pan itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add whatever additional ingredients you choose - green onion, sliced
        mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, etc. If you would like your quesadilla to
        be a chicken quesadilla, add some diced cooked chicken. <br />Take care
        not to layer on the ingredients too thickly - this is a quesadilla, not
        a quiche!
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. The pan should be hot enough
        by now to have plenty of residual heat to melt the cheese and brown the
        tortilla. If the quesadilla begins to smoke too much, remove from the
        heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        After a minute, check to see if the cheese is melted. If not, return the
        cover and keep checking every minute until the cheese is melted.
        <br />When the cheese is sufficiently melted, use a spatula to lift up
        one side of the quesadilla and flip over the other side, as if you were
        making an omelette.
      </li>
      <li>
        The tortilla should by now be browned slightly. If it is not browned,
        turn the heat up to high and flip the quesadilla over every 10 seconds
        or so until it gets browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove quesadilla from pan cut into wedges. <br />
        To make the lettuce to accompany the quesadilla, thinly slice some
        iceberg lettuce. Sprinkle some cider vinegar on it and some salt. Serve
        with the lettuce, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.
      </li>
